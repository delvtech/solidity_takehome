1. The contract has a modifier the owner of the contract is checked. It uses an || (or) operator to check 
for the owner. The first part checks if the msg.sender == owner and the second part of the or checks for if
the msg.sender != tx.origin. tx.origin is the address that submitted the current transaction. So if the first 
condition of the or statement fails, the second part will be true thereby having unintended consequences.

2. The function claimProfits is susceptible to reentrance attack. The onlyOwner modifier as explained in
point one is wrongly written. So anyone can call this function. The balance of the caller should have be
reset to 0 to prevent the user for reentry the contract and withdrawing all the ether in the contract.

3. The mapping usedSignatures was never initialized. The values are the default values.

4. The deposits and withdraw functions performs a transfer without checking the returned value from the token. Some tokens
do not revert when the transfer fail and if this happens the user will be allowed to call the remaining portion
of the code.

5. The deposit and withdraw functions is running a delegate call on a user inputed address. An 
attacker could provide an address which can steal funds or self destruct the contract. Delegate call
should be avoided when necessary and if you don't trust the source of the input contract that you are delegating to.
